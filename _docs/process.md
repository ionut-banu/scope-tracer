Orchestrator

The main session is the orchestrator. It launches the PM, the engineer
and QA as subagents. It does not groom, implement or test itself.

Lifecycle

1. Pick the next open issue from the backlog
2. PM grooms it
3. Engineer implements it on a branch, in its own worktree
4. QA verifies it on that branch, in that worktree
5. On FAIL, back to step 3 with the QA comment as input
6. On PASS, push the branch and open a pull request into `main`
7. Stop. A human reviews and merges it, and the merge closes the issue
8. Repeat until the backlog is empty

Rules

- Do not skip step 2
- The engineer does not close the issue
- QA does not fix the code, only outputs PASS or FAIL
- Nobody closes an issue by hand. The pull request says `Closes #N`
  and merging it does the closing, so an issue can never be closed
  while its code is still unmerged.
- Nobody merges the pull request except a human. QA passing means the
  work is ready to be looked at, not that it is ready to land.
- The orchestrator never fixes the code itself. Fixing in the main
  session skips QA entirely and is how unverified work gets closed.
- Dependabot pull requests are outside this loop. A human reads CI on
  them and merges or closes them.

Labels and milestones

Every issue carries a milestone, one `kind:` label, and one `area:`
label. The PM applies them while grooming; an issue that reaches the
engineer without them was not groomed.

- `kind:` - `feature`, `bug`, `chore`, `process`. What sort of work it is.
- `area:` - `core`, `analyzer`, `agent`, `plugin`, `demos`, `tests`,
  `build`, `docs`. Matches the module table in §3 of the spec, so the
  labels stay true as the code grows rather than drifting into their
  own vocabulary. `tests` is shared test infrastructure and the
  stress module; `build` is Maven, CI and release.
- `blocked` - waiting on another issue. Say which one in a comment.

Three more record where an issue came from, and only the orchestrator
applies them:

- `from: review` - a finding from the milestone reviewer
- `from: qa` - something QA found that was outside the issue it was
  testing
- `from: user` - reported by someone using scope-tracer, not by this
  team

Those three matter more than they look. Most issues here come from
the maintainer's own plans. The ones that came from the machinery
finding real problems, or from real users hitting them, are the
evidence that the process works and that the tool is used, and they
are worth being able to list.

A pull request carries the same labels and milestone as the issue it
closes.

Writing for GitHub

Do not hard-wrap anything that goes into an issue body, a pull request
body, or a comment. GitHub renders a single newline in those as an
actual line break rather than reflowing the paragraph, so text wrapped
at 70 columns comes out as a column of ragged short lines.

One paragraph is one line, however long. One list item is one line,
however long. Let the browser wrap it. Fenced code blocks are
unaffected - wrap those however the code reads best.

This is the opposite of the convention for files in `_docs/`, which are
read as text and stay wrapped at about 70 columns. The difference is
where it will be rendered, not who wrote it.

One worktree per subagent

A branch is not enough isolation. The orchestrator works on `main` in
the main directory while a subagent works on a branch, and there is
only one working directory - so `git checkout` from either side
changes the files under the other. (In historian, the project this
process came from, that happened twice in one minute on its second
issue: a module vanished from under QA mid-review, and a
documentation commit landed on a feature branch.)

So each implementing subagent gets its own directory:

    git worktree add ../scope-tracer-issue-7 -b issue-7-dynamic-attach

The engineer and QA work there. The orchestrator stays in the main
directory on `main` and never checks out a feature branch. Remove it
when the pull request merges:

    git worktree remove ../scope-tracer-issue-7

Neither side can then disturb the other, and no amount of care is
required to keep it that way.

A worktree carries a second hazard that a directory does not fix:
the local Maven repository. `~/.m2/repository` is one directory,
shared by the main checkout and every worktree, and every module here
is the same `0.3.0-SNAPSHOT` in all of them. Two things follow:

- `mvn -pl scope-tracer-analyzer test` without `-am` does not build
  `scope-tracer-core` - it takes whatever core jar is in `~/.m2`.
  That is whichever checkout last ran `mvn install`, which may be
  `main`, a stale build, or another issue's branch. The analyzer's
  tests then pass or fail against code that is not on this branch.
- `mvn install` inside a worktree replaces those jars for everyone.
  The orchestrator's next `-pl` run on `main` would test against the
  branch.

The rule therefore has to hold at every invocation, not once at
`git worktree add`: never run `mvn -pl <module>` without `-am`. With
`-am`, or with no `-pl` at all, Maven builds the sibling modules from
the worktree's own sources in the same reactor and never consults
`~/.m2` for them. `mvn install` is allowed only where a command needs
it (the stress tests, the demos' classpath), and then it is followed
by the full `mvn -q verify` from the same worktree before anything is
reported.

Everything else that locates a jar is already worktree-local: the
agent ITs and the stress tests find the agent fat-jar through
`${project.basedir}/../scope-tracer-agent/target/`, the plugin's
`copyAnalyzerJar` reads `../scope-tracer-analyzer/target/`, and the
demo commands in `README.md` put this tree's `target/` jars first on
the classpath.

Run this once on entering a worktree, before anything else, and
confirm the first line is the worktree's own directory, not the main
checkout, and the second is the branch named for the issue:

    git rev-parse --show-toplevel
    git branch --show-current

No one-off check can catch the `~/.m2` hazard, because it lives in
the command rather than the directory. So every report says which
Maven commands it ran, and a verdict or report built on a `-pl` run
without `-am` is not evidence about the branch.

Branches and pull requests

One branch per issue, named for it - `issue-7-dynamic-attach`. The
engineer creates it, commits to it, and never touches `main`.

The pull request is opened by the orchestrator after QA passes, not by
the engineer. It carries `Closes #N`, a link to the QA verdict comment,
the test result, and anything known-broken and deliberately deferred.
It is the one place a human sees the whole change at once, so it is
written for a reader who has not followed the issue.

Step 7 is a real stop. The loop does not continue to the next issue
while a pull request is waiting, unless the next issue is independent
of the one under review - and an issue that touches the event schema
or `TraceModelJson` is never independent of anything downstream of it.

Progress lives in the issues

Not in this session, and not in a checklist file. An issue is done when
it is closed, and what happened to it is in its comments. If this
session is lost or compacted, the backlog is still exactly where it
was, so re-read the issues rather than trusting recollection about what
was finished.

Do not add a plan file with checkboxes. It would be a third copy of
work already described by the spec and tracked by the issues, and the
copy that is nobody's job to update is the one that goes stale while
still looking authoritative. Progress within a single task is the
engineer's own business and disappears with it.

Review at milestone boundaries

When a milestone's last issue closes, dispatch the reviewer over the
whole milestone's diff before starting the next one.

It is a separate role from QA on purpose. QA is deliberately blind to
the implementation - it checks behaviour against the acceptance
criteria and is told to ignore what the code claims about itself. That
blindness is what makes it hard to fool, and reading the code for
quality would destroy it. So the two jobs stay apart, and the reading
one runs once per milestone rather than once per issue.

Its findings become issues. Nobody fixes them in place.

The loop has a ceiling

Step 5 is bounded at three rounds. Each engineer subagent is fresh, so
the issue thread is its memory - every dispatch reads the prior QA
comments and the engineer's own replies.

- Rounds 1 and 2: dispatch a fresh engineer with the QA comment
- Round 3: dispatch on a more capable model, saying plainly that two
  attempts already failed and pointing at the thread

After round 3, stop dispatching and decide. An engineer that has
failed three times is usually not the problem:

- **An acceptance criterion is wrong or impossible.** Send it back to
  the PM, fix the issue, restart at round one.
- **The task is too large.** Split it, close this issue as superseded,
  and link the pieces.
- **The spec is wrong.** Fix `_docs/spec.md`, record why in
  `_docs/decisions.md`, restart at round one.
- **It is a real limitation nobody needs solved yet.** File a follow-up
  issue, say so in a comment, and let QA pass what remains.

What is forbidden is a fourth round. Three failures on the same code
means something upstream is wrong, and dispatching again just pays to
discover that more slowly.

Models

Every subagent that does not name a model inherits this session's,
which is the most expensive one. Name a model on every dispatch.

- **PM** - mid-tier (`sonnet`). Grooming is judgment about edge
  cases, not depth.
- **QA** - mid-tier (`sonnet`). The verdict comes from running a real
  scope under a real recording, not from reasoning.
- **Engineer** - mid-tier (`sonnet`) by default. Use the most capable
  model (`opus`) for work that is design rather than transcription:
  anything in agent advice or the bootstrap classloader, the
  nesting detection, the event schema, and the plugin/analyzer
  process boundary.
- **Reviewer** - most capable (`opus`). It runs rarely, and reading a
  milestone of code for what is wrong with it is the hardest job here.
- **Escalation** - one tier up from whatever just failed.

Each role's full definition - what it does, and what counts as
done - lives in `_docs/team/`: `pm.md`, `software-engineer.md`,
`qa-engineer.md`, `reviewer.md`.

Cheapest is not the same as fastest. A weak model on a task beyond it
takes several times the turns and costs more than the right one would
have. Mid-tier is the floor, not the target.

The oracle

Correctness in this project is decided by the JDK, not by opinion.
The trace has to describe what `StructuredTaskScope` actually did -
which task failed, which was interrupted, which scope was open inside
which task - so the only acceptable evidence is a real scope, run
under a real JFR recording, read back with `RecordingFile`. The
pattern is in §4 of `_docs/spec.md`.

Things nobody reasons about, because they can be measured:

- Whether a sibling of a failed task is cancelled, or completes,
  under a given `Joiner`. Run it and record it.
- Whether an event is emitted on the task thread or the owner thread.
  Read `getThread()` off the recorded event.
- Whether an older recording still parses. Keep or produce one and
  parse it.

Two consequences for the process:

- QA runs the full `mvn -q verify` itself and, for any agent change,
  the stress profile. QA is expected to find failures the engineer's
  tests did not. A FAIL from a stress run is a normal outcome, not an
  escalation.
- The test count never goes down. An issue that reduces it is a FAIL
  regardless of its acceptance criteria. The count is the sum of
  surefire and failsafe totals from `mvn verify`; it was 180 on
  2026-10-02 (§4 of the spec).

The spec is binding

`_docs/spec.md` is the source of truth and describes scope-tracer as
it currently is. Every issue names the section it implements.

It is the only specification. If you find another document in this
repository describing what scope-tracer should do, it is stale. Do not
act on it, do not reconcile it with the spec, and do not average the
two. Say what you found, in a comment on the issue, and use the spec.

Three documents are exceptions, and none of them is a specification.
They describe what exists today, for people outside the team, and
must be updated when behaviour changes:

- `README.md` - for someone who has just arrived
- `docs/jfr-events.md` - the published event schema, for anyone
  reading a `.jfr` file directly. §2 of the spec defers to it for
  field-level detail, so it is kept exact.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` - for outside contributors and
  for release notes

Never implement from them. If one contradicts the spec, it is wrong
and gets fixed.

Nothing that is no longer true is kept in the working tree. Superseded
plans live in git history. `_docs/decisions.md` is the one exception,
because every entry is dated and written as a past decision, so
reading it cannot be mistaken for reading current requirements.

The non-goals and invariants in §1 are binding. Work that contradicts
them does not get implemented and does not get argued about in an
issue comment - it gets filed as a separate issue for the maintainer
to decide on, and dropped from the current one.

Decisions made while building go in `_docs/decisions.md`, newest last,
one short entry each. If a decision contradicts the spec, the spec is
edited in the same commit.
